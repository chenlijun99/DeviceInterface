= Device configuration file specification

The configuration file has three arrays: `registers`, `parameters` and `flags`
Each of these array contain list of respectively `Register`, `Parameter` and `Flag`
object

== Registers

`registers` is a array of object of type `Register`.

.Register
|====
|Key|Type|Description|Misc

|name|string|the register's name|*required*
|address|integer (lower than 65535)|the register's address |*required*
|description|string|the register's description|optional
|writable|boolean|whether register is writable|optional
|readble|boolean|whether register is readable|optional
|====
== Parameters

`parameters` is a array of object of type `Parameter`.

|====
|Key|Type|Description|Misc

|name|string|the register's name|*required*

|addresses|array of integers (lower than 65535)|the addresses in which this parameter is stored 
since a Parameter can have a size that doesn't fit into one single cell
|*required* but mutually exclusive with _registers_ below

|registers|array of strings|the name of the registers in which this parameter is stored
|*required* but mutually exclusive with _addresses_ above

|size| a integer (< = than addresses.length * 8)
|if defined specify the number of bits took into consideration, the remaining
ones are ignored|optional

|description|string|the parameter's description|optional

|writable|boolean|whether parameter is writable|optional but mutually exclusive with `registers` above

|readble|boolean|whether parameter is readable|optional but mutually exclusive with `registers` above
|====

NOTE: `addresses` have to be written from the most significant to the least one.

NOTE: If `registers` is defined instead of `addresses`, the read&write permissions
of them must be the same

== Flags

`flags` is a array of object of type `Flag`.

|====
|Key|Type|Description|Misc

|name|string|the flag's name|*required*

|address|integer (lower than 65535)|the addresses in which the state of this flag is stored 
|*required* but mutually exclusive with _register_ below

|registers|string|the name of the register in which this flag is stored
|*required* but mutually exclusive with _address_ above

|nthbit|integer (1-8)|the position of the bit representing this flag in `address` or
`register`|*required*

|description|string|the flag's description|optional

|on|string|name of the flag when on|optional

|off|string|name of the flag when off|optional

|writable|boolean|whether flag is writable|optional but mutually exclusive with `registers` above

|readble|boolean|whether flag is readable|optional but mutually exclusive with `registers` above
|====

NOTE: The address range has been limited to 0-65535 because this program
is meant to work with embedded devices, which can handle usually <= 16 bit
addressing.
If this is not true, please contradict me. I'll be pleased to refactor
my ugly code...

WARNING: For a security reason, if access permissions are not defined anywhere,
the default permissions will be set: no write no read!
